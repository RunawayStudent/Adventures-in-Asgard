                                                    It takes him over an hour to agree, a process not helped by the series of smug comments Loki insists on making, but the thunder god finally relents, and stalks away. He's gone for now, but he won't forget this.

He's in a blind rage now, and for a few seconds it looks like he might kill you. Then Loki calls out of your home in an uncharictaristically shrill voice.

                                                    "I can fix it!" he yelps, "I can fix Sif's hair!"

                                                    "Hrrr." he growls, and Loki hurries to explain.

                                                    "The dwarves. They can make new hair. I can get them to. Just give me some time."

                                                    Thor stares up at him, grunts again, then lowers his axe and turns to walk away.

                                                        The God of Thunder stares for a few more seconds, then lowers his axe and turns to walk away.

                                        He glares back at you a little longer, then turns and stalks away. He's gone for now, but he won't forget this.

                    Loki does his best to swallow. Sif is the much loved wife of the thunder god Thor. She takes a great deal of pride in her golden hair, and has a sharp tongue that rivals even Freya's. She and Thor adore each other, and they constantly appear at each other's sides and enter each other's space. Thor is absolutely willing to kill over this..

        Loki nods.

        He's probably right though; if anyone can make magical hair for Sif, it's the dwarves. Unfortunately, it's notoriously hard to buy their favour - almost anything people can offer them they can make.

                There is immediate interest, and two dwarves approach you from different tables.

                "I am Brokk." says one, "My brother and I are the greatest smiths around. We can make perfect hair for you."

                The other dwarf shakes his head furiously.

                "No!" he bursts out, "My three brothers and I are the sons of Ivaldi - the greatest smith ever! We can make much better hair than Brokk and Eitri! We'll even make other gifts for you, too!"

                Brokk glares at him.

                "So will we."

                        "He'll make the hair." Brokk decides, "My brother and I will make three other gifts. For Thor, Odin and Frey. Meet back here in two days."

                        Then he turns around and walks out of the tavern.

                        Ivaldi's son stares after him open-mouthed.

                        "That… He… That wretch!"

                        He turns to you.

                        "Right. I'll make three gifts then, and you can be sure they'll be better than his. You'll be the judge."

                        Then he stamps away.

                You explain Sif's situation to them, and they confer, then two dwarves approch you.

                "I am Brokk." says one, "My brother and I are the greatest smiths around. We can make perfect hair for you."

                The other dwarf shakes his head furiously.

                Brokk glares at him.

                "So will we."

                        *label ivaldi
                        He grins, and leads you to his smithy. There, all four sons of Ivaldi set to work.

                        Watching them is amazing - they weave molten metal more swiftly and efficiently than a spider weaves a web, and it isn't long before you have a golden wig before you, which the sons assure you will bond with Sif's head.

                        "We will do you two more gifts." one of them decides, "Who do you want them for?"

                                            "For Loki." they say, "Whatever is seen by this eye is seen by its owner, and it can be commanded to fly anywhere."

                                            "For Baldur." they say, "This breastplate is unbreakable, and whoever wears it shall rule on the battlefield."

                                            "For Njord." they say, "This hook only has to be submerged for a few seconds before it will catch a fish, and no line that is attached to it can break."

                                            They take some silver and a handful of precious stones, and fashion a necklace. When they show it to you, you can't help gasping at its beauty. You feel jealousy twinge inside you as you take it.

                                            "And that's for Freya. The most beautiful item for the most beautiful goddess."

                                            One of the sons of Ivaldi gets un unpleasant leer on his face.

                                            "And this is for Frigg. If she focuses on the grain in the wood, it will tell of the next death to come near to her."

                                            They offer it to you when they're done.

                                            "This is for Sigyn. Any bowl placed on one side will hold exactly the weight that she places on the other."

                                            They take a large spiderweb and get to work on it, forming a gossamer veil.

                                            "And this is for Vor. It enhances the sight of its wearer, and it captures all of their memories."

                                            They take a block of gold and melt it, then stretch it out into threads. Then, they weave the threads into a long, thin band.

                                            "This is for the goddess Fulla. When she wishes, it will hide her."

                                            They melt an iron ingot and stretch it into threads, then start to weave. Eventually, they present you with a silvery dress.

                                            "And this is for Idunn. When she wears it, she will be safe from all outside harm, and it will never be dirty."

                                            You smile at him and present him with the horse's reins.

                                            "I got you a gift." you say, "He can find you wherever you, and will always be able to hear you."

                                            He takes the reins and lays a hand on the animal's neck, and it nickers.

                                            "Thank you." he says, sounding genuinely touched as he strokes the horse's nose.

                                            She reaches out, and can't supress a grin when she feels it. She unties her scarf and raises the hair to her head. A shimmer runs through it, and she gasps. You have to admit, the new hair looks spectactular.
                                            
                                            Thor kneels in front of her to take her hands and kisses them.

                        "My brother has been planning a gift for Thor for a long time." he tells you, "You made the right choice."

                        First, Eitri, who doesn't say a word and won't meet your eye, takes a block of gold and places it in his forge. He nods at Brokk and moves into a little room around the back where he can access the forge. Brokk takes a hold of the bellows.

                        "My brother doesn't like talking to people." he explains, and there's no hint of apology in his tone. 

                        You watch as he starts to pump, and eventually Eitri comes back. He removes the gold, now shaped like hair, and holds in tongs as it cools. Then he lays it down on a table and examines it, then turns to Brokk and taps the back of his wrist.

                        "It's finished." says Brokk, as Eitri takes an enormous slab of iron and puts it in the forge.

                        This time they work for much longer, and Brokk's face glistens with sweat as he works the bellows.

                        Finally, Eitri returns, and draws a magnificent hammer out of the forge. He plunges it into an ice bath, then raises it and studies it. Then he drops it on the table and taps his wrist again.

                        He walks over to the big shelf where he keeps materials and scans it, while Brokk explains the properties of the hammer.

                        Then Eitri produces another block of gold and carries it to the forge. He meets his brother's eye and touches his forehead, then returns to his work-room.

                        "This one's for Odin." Brokk explains as he takes up the bellows again.

                        This time, when Eitri takes his creation from the forge, it's a beautiful, solid arm-ring. Brokk explains its properties, and then you compliment their skill and return home.

                            "Three gifts each then. My brother already has plans for one for Thor." - he nods at Ivaldi's son - "You can do the hair."

                            Ivaldi's son bristles. 

                            "That'll be easy." he says, "So I get to choose the other gods."

                            Brokk nods again and the other dwarf stares upwards.

                            "Frey." he says, "I have a good idea for him… And Odin. Best not to snub the Allfather, eh?"

                            "Alright." says Brokk, "Three gifts. The winner, as judged by $[name], will be known as the greatest craftsman in Svartalfheim."

                            They agree to meet back here in two days, and then they leave to go to their respective smithies.

                            *set skidbladnir true
                            Two days later, Brokk and all four of Ivaldi's sons are before you.

                            Ivaldi's sons go first. They start by showing you the golden hair for Sif, which is far more impressive than you expected - it shines beautifuly.

                            Then they place a long spear on the table. It's a masterpice, with delicate runework all along it, and it looks fantastic.

                            "This is Gungnir." one of them explains, "It never misses its target when thrown, and any oath sworn on it is unbreakable. We thought it would suit Odin."

                            Then they take out a folded cloth. It has a pretty, embroidered design - runes of some kind - but it doesn't look like much.

                            "This is Skidbladnir, for the god, Frey." says another one, "When you unfold it, it becomes a ship big enough to carry all of the gods, and wherever it sails it will have a following wind."

                            They exchange satisfied glances, and the one you spoke to first gives Brokk a smug look.
                            *page_break
                            *set draupnir true
                            Brokk ignores Ivaldi's son and places a golden arm-ring on the table.

                            "My brother and I call this Draupnir. Every nine nights, eight golden arm-rings drip from it." - He offers a nasty smile to Ivaldi's sons - "Infinate wealth. Should impress Odin."
                            
                            Then he heads outside the tavern and brings in an enormous golden boar on a chain. It snorts furiously and takes a swipe at one of valdi's sons on the way past.

                            "He's called Gullinbursti. The golden-maned." 

                            He pats the animal's back and it snorts.

                            "He can carry a god, and he never tires. He can run across the sky and the sea, and he has glowing bristles in his mane to light his owner's way. We made him for Frey."

                            He wraps the boar's chain around the table leg, then reaches into his pocket.

                            "This is the true masterpiece." he tells you, as he produces a tiny hammer from his pocket. It grows as he lowers it to the table, becomming impressively large.

                            "It's called Mjollnir, and it's for Thor. It never misses a target, it can't be broken, and it will return to the user's hand. You can shrink it to hide it, or so it can be carried by someone other than Thor. A truly fantasic piece."

                            Then he leans forwards, and you can smell his sour breath as he whispers the secret of the hammer's growth into your ear.

                            "Well!" Ivaldi's son interrupts impatiently, "Judge us!"
                            *choice
                                #"Brokk and Eitri win."
                                    Brokk nods in satisfaction, then walks away, smiling dourly.

                                    Ivaldi's sons glare at you, then move to the bar to drink, while you gather up the gifts. Gullinbursti studies you with mad piggy eyes, but allows you to take the end of his chain, and you head for home.
                                    *goto backtoasgard
                                #"Ivaldi's sons win."
                                    Ivaldi's sons high five each other cheerfully, and head to the bar to celebrate, while Brokk simply walks away.

                                    You gather up the gifts. Gullinbursti studies you with mad piggy eyes, but allows you to take the end of his chain, and you head for home.

                        *else
                            They exchange glances, but Brokk shakes his head.

                            "No." he says, and walks away.

                            Ivaldi's son smirks at his departing back, then turns back to you.
                            *goto ivaldi
            #True. I'll ask Loki.
                *set loki %-10
                You run after the trickster and he turns to face you, raising elegant eyebrows.

                "Mmm?"

                "Maybe you should talk to them."

                He smirks.

                "What? You need my help? Well, I suppose…"

                He trails off as he catches your expression. 

                "Yeah… I'll deal with it."

                He taps you on the shoulder, then strides off towards the Bifrost, stopping briefly on the way to drag a piece of metal along the edge of Baldur's house.
                *page_break
                He stays away for a few days, and Sif stays in her home the whole time, while Thor stamps around starting fights with people.
                *goto gift_gathering
    #"Now, I go talk to Sif."
        svs
    #"Now, you find a way to fix Sif's hair."
        *set loki %-10
        "Do I have to?"

        He looks at your expression and sighs.

        "I suppose I could talk to the dwarfs." he muses, then "Fine. I'll deal with it."

        He strides off towards the B, stopping briefly on the way to drag a piece of metal along the edge of Baldur's house.

Then Loki returns Asgard, accompanied by a strange dwarf.

He announces loudly that he brings gifts for Odin, Thor and Frey, and that he will present them in Valhalla. He also requests that all of the gods be present.

"The reason," he says, once everyone has gathered, "that I have asked so many of my friends here" -  eyebrows raise around the room at the word - "is to judge a competetion between myseef and this… person, Brokk. We have each prepared three gifts - one each for the Allfather," - Odin gives a slight nod - "the thunder god," - Thor glares at him and grunts - "and my dear friend Frey."

Frey looks surprised, perhaps at his inclusion, or perhaps at being called Loki's friend.

"After the competition, you all get to vote on the victor. If I lose…" - his eyes become incredibly wide - "he gets my head."

"Present them." commands Odin.
