        You're spending the day with Freya, watching her warriors wrestle, when a furious shout shakes Asgard.

        "[i]My hammer![/i]"

        Freya shuts her eyes and sighs.

        "That doesn't sound good." she says.

                She nods reluctantly, and the two of you go to find Thor: a task made quite easy by by his continuous, loud raging.

                As you approach Thor's hall, Sif runs over to you. 
                *if sifhair="content"
                    She looks good, her head shining and her face natural, but she's clearly very worried.

                Freya takes her hands gently.

                "It'll be alright." she says, "We'll find it."

                Sif nods, taking a deep breath, then jumps in alarm as Thor crashes through the door and storms off.

                        "I'll find it." he decides.

                        Thor stops pacing, surprised, and Loki shrugs.

                "There was an eagle." he groans, "It didn't look natural. I didn't say anything because I thought it was Odin. Thinking back, it could have been a giant."

                "Do you have any idea who?" you ask.

                He stares into the distance, scanning the worlds.

                You recognise the name - it belongs to a powerful giant, and this wouldn't be the first time he's made trouble for Asgard.

                He taps the side of his jaw.

                "My guess is Thrym. He's powerful, with a lot of followers, and he's very interested in Asgard. He shouldn't be hard to find."

                                                With the giant's attention off you, you scramble up and run away. When you get far enough, Sleipnir flashes to your side, and you mount him and dash away. As you ride for Asgard, Thrym calls out to you.

        You close your eyes and abandon the constricting world of solid reality, dancing from dream to dream, searching for the name Thrym.

        You find it quickly, through the dreams of one of his servants. Picking out the reality from amongst the fantasy with practiced ease, you dicover that Thrym does indeed have the hammer. He has hidden it, and his servant doesn't know where. He plans to ransom it in exchange for Freya's hand in marriage. Then the servant wakes, and you are thrust back into your body.

You fly towards Jotunheim, and your sharp eyes quickly pick out an ice giant waiting on the route. He peers up at you, squinting against the light, then waves cheerfully. As you fly down to land beside him, he smiles widely, and lays down the golden dog-lead he was plaiting. You see his name on his silver necklace - Thrym.

                Thor curses you at a volume loud enough to deafen a non-god, and Odin stares right through you with his one eye, and shakes his head. Even your friends among the gods are disappointed, and this is one incident they will not forget.

        Thor approches you joyfully, reaching out for his hammer, but you raise it and warn him to stay back.

        "I'm keeping it." you tell him, "If you want to try and take itâ€¦"

        You smash the hammer through a nearby wall and stare at him. For a moment, it looks like he might take you up on that, but then Sif runs forwards and catches his arm.

        "Don'tâ€¦" she pleads, and he snorts in rage, then throws back his head and bellows, "ODINNN!"

        As the shout reverberates around Asgard, gods start to emerge. They whisper between themselves, working out what's going on, then cast you hateful glares. Even Baldur and Idunn, chronically nice people, look furious, although you notice that Loki seems mostly amused.  
        *if relationship="Freya"
            Freya steps to your side, loyal even in the face of the anger of all of Asgard. If it turns into a fight, she will back you. 
        
        The muttering dies down as Odin strides down from Valhalla. He's his full, terrifying self today, twelve feet tall with fire in his eye and shadows dancing around him. His ravens, Huginn and Muninn perch on his shoulders, glaring at you with black eyes, and Geri and Freki pad beside him, their wolf's teeth bared.

        "Explain." the Allfather commands, in a voice that has sent thousands to their deaths, and knows it.

        You gaze at him calmly.

        "I am keeping this hammer." you tell him, "I can be just as effective with it as Thor."

        Odin frowns, and you can almost see the thoughts rumbling through his mind. He cannot fight you without losing too many people. He cannot send you away, because you would take the hammer and leave Asgard undefended. All he can do it accept your ultimatum, and plot fot the future.

        He nods, slowly and decisively, and ther's an explosion of noise, headed by Thor booming, "No!"

        Odin quiets his son with a fiery look, then returns his attention to you.

        "Keep it." he says, then turns and walks back to Valhalla.

    Loki grins.

Without Thor's hammer, the giants could see the gods as weaker and press the advantage, threatening Midgard, and maybe even Asgard itself.

    Freya glares at them.

    "[i]Quiet![/i]" she snaps, "It was taken by Thrym. He wants to marry me, which is impossible, so we need to find another way."

                In the past, Asgard had a strict separation between the men and the women. The men would meet in the hall of Gladsheimr, and the women in Vingolf.

                        The gods start by letting out a dress. Sif is a particularly big woman, with a lot of curves, but even[i] her[/i] dresses have no chance of containing Thor, and there's no way his impressive gut is fitting into a corset, so Fulla alters one.

                        "He has very wide shoulders." Sigyn worries, but Loki, who's already become a pretty woman, just laughs.

                        "So does Sif. And every pretty giantess. That's not a problem. Trust me."

                        "And the beard?" Sif asks, "They probably won't be expecting one on [i]Freya[/i] of all people."

                        "I'm not shaving." Thor warns, and the gods break off into a gaggle.

                            "Vor has a beautiful veil." Baldur suggests, "It would cover the beard [i]and[/i] look stunning."

                            He turns to nod at Fulla, and she scurries off to fetch it.

                            "It kind of smells of smoke." she whispers, concered, but Thor shrugs.

                            "That's fine."

                        "And Freya's aren't?"

                        "Not like that. And giants like cold blue eyes."

                        "We can put big flowers in the headress," says Idunn, "and pull it down low. It'll draw the attention off his eyes, and cover them a bit."

                        Thor has been completely transformed. His mad red hair has been tamed and woven into an enormous flowery headdress, pulled down low over his eyes. His beard is covered by a silky veil, and he's wearing a gorgous dress. He looks genuinely beautiful.

When Thor emerges from Vingolf, he's been completely transformed. His mad red hair has been tamed and woven into an enormous flowery headdress, pulled down low over his eyes. His beard is covered by a silky veil, and he's wearing a gorgous dress. He looks genuinely beautiful.
*label away

"Shall we go?" you ask him, "Odin arranged a time and place for the wedding."

He nods decisively and prepares his sled - a comfortable thing full of furs and drawn by goats - ready to leave. The two of you get in it and drive to Jotunheim for the wedding.
*page_break
You have to admit as you enter Thrym's hall, it's an impressive place. Towering ice sculptures loom beside enormous doors, and every inch of the walls has been decorated with blooms bigger than your head. As you enter, well-dressed giants gather to watch you, and the sound of their muttering is like a distant avalanche. Thrym really has pulled out all the stops.

The Lord himself strides out and peers down at you. There's a flicker of confusion in his eyes - perhaps he's wondering why he isn't feeling the rush of infatuation and lust that normally accompanies Freya. Then he shakes his head and smiles with a mouth that could fit you, Thor, and the chariot inside it, and still have room for a few humans.

"I welcome the goddess Freya to my hall!" he announces, proudly.

"She is honoured by your invitation!" you call up to him, a polite response.

"Come! I have prepared a feast."

Beside you, you feel Thor straighten up in anticipation. He smiles under his veil as you climb out of the sled and head into the feasting hall. As you walk there, Thrym leans down to get a little closer to Thor, and you hear his gargantuan whisper.

"Eat fast. The sooner we're married, the sooner we can go to my bedroom."

Thor tenses, and you can tell that he's about to lose control.

The two of you sit down on terrifyingly high stools, clearly made specially for the occasion, and food is placed before you by giant servants.

"Eat!" booms Thrym, "And enjoy!"

Thor does.

He starts with the sweetmeats, shoving them under his veil like a hungry monkey that's broken into a kitchen. It takes him less then a minute to finish all of them, to the shock of the other giants. Then he starts on the food, scoffing an entire oxen - one of the enormous ones the giants breed. As Thor moves onto the casks of mead, Thrym leans over to you.

"The gorgeous Freya has a big appetite." he says, sounding like he can't decide whether to be confused or impressed.

            and you can almost see him thinking things over. The food, the goats, the lack of infatuation.

            "She's not Freyaâ€¦" he murmurs, and then he leaps to his feet in rage, "She's not Freya!"

            Thor springs up from the table and strikes him over the head with a giant lamb bone. The bone shatters, and Thrym drops to the ground, dead.

            Thrym scowls as he returns to sit by you.

            "On a weddingâ€¦ That's bad luck."

            He thinks for a few seconds, then nods decisively.

His servants hurry from the hall, and he gives Thor a toothy grin.

"Almost ready, my sweet." he leers, and Thor stews but stays silent.
*page_break
A few minutes later, the servants return, struggling to carry Mjolnir between them, and Thor brightens under his veil.

"Place it on Freya's lap!" Thrym orders, and the servants do as they're told.

For a second it sits there, and everything is still. Then Thor gives a joyous bellow, seizes the handle of the hammer, and throws it hard, striking Thrym in the skull.

It's back in his hand before the shocked silence is over, and he charges one of Thrym's sisters with a roar.

It doesn't take him long to clear the room, and by the time he's done, both of you are covered with blood.

Thor looks down at his dress with a satisfied smile, and then lowers his hammer to his side.

"Come on." he says cheerily, wandering back towards his sled, "Let's get back home."
*page_break
As you get back to Asgard, Thor waves his hammer victoriously, and the waiting gods chatter with relief. Sif comes haring out of the gates, and Thor picks her up and spins her around, getting blood all over her dress.

There are celebrations in Asgard that night, and they go on well into the next day. Everyone is intensely relieved, and this incident will stick in their minds for a while. You and Heimdall came out of it pretty well.

        Thor slumps as he realises you're right. He looks around, as if hoping the hammer will be up on one of the walls, then starts to trudge towards his sled. You take as last look at the carnage before you follow him. You have a feeling that Asgard is about to be at war with the giants again.

He lifts her up and spins her around as Loki steps delicately out of the sled.

Unlike Thor, there isn't a speck of blood on his dress - his? hers? You can never tell with Loki, and he certainly doesn't[i] care[/i] what you call him - and only a little in his hair. He smiles widely and strides into Asgard.

You bow to him, then retreat with the more fashion conscious gods to Vingolf, the hall of the goddesses.

In the past, Asgard had a strict separation between the men and the women. The men would meet in the hall of Gladsheimr, and the women in Vingolf.

When Loki, the consumate shapeshifter, arrived in Asgard, the line between 'man' and 'woman' were blurred. When he gave birth the first eight times, it was demolished. These days, which hall a particular god spends time in is purely down to their interests, and Vingolf is the place for getting dressed up for a wedding.

They give you a beautiful headress, too - always the most important part of a bride's outfit - and hang jewelry all over you.

Then you head out to the gates of Asgard, where Odin has arranges a sled to carry you and Loki to Jotunheim.

Then one of the giantesses - perhaps Thrym's sister? - gives a frustrated shout, and hurls a spear at you. You step out of its way, but that doesn't really matter.

The water surges past you, but you easily direct it around you and Loki. Then you flow out of the rubble that's all that remains of Thrym's magnificent hall.

                    You pick up a handful of rocks and start hurling them at giants, smashing in skulls. Once they're all dead, you drop the remaining rocks and take a deep breath.

                Loki emerges from his hiding place, giving you an expression that could best be described as contemptous.

                "Well done." he drawls sardonically, "We won't find the hammer now."

                He shakes his head.

                "Let's go back to Asgard."

                As you arrive back at Asgard, the waiting gods glare at you. They already seem to know what happened - perhaps Huginn and Muninn were following you? - and they're angry. 
                *if freya>95
                    Freya walks over to you, silently supportive amidst the glowering. 
                Odin glares down at you and shakes his head, and the gods retreat to their individual homes. 


                With Asgard less defended and a handful of dead giants whose families will want blood, this has been a disaster, and you in particular have come off badly.

            #Stay quiet.
                "Let's eat first, shall we?" Loki suggests, and Thrym nods, still smirking.

    #Stay quiet.
        You smile at him, but stay quiet, letting Loki do the talking.

        "Yes, you can." he says.

*label feast
The three of you, along with a few dozen other giants, sit down at the high table. Some terrifyingly tall and thin stools have been prepared for you and Loki, and you gingerly balance on one, then start on the food. Thrym has spared no expense; the table is stacked high with meat and fish and sweetmeats and every kind of bread, and huge casks of mead - big enough to make a ship out of - sit nearby.

You eat and drink for a while, and then Thrym stands up.

"Bring the hammer!" he shouts, "It's time!"

His servants hurry from the hall, and he gives you a toothy grin.

"Almost ready, my sweet." he leers.
*page_break
A few minutes later, the servants return, struggling to carry Mjolnir between them, and you feel your hand itching to grab it.

"Place it on Freya's lap!" Thrym orders, and the servants do as they're told.

You caress the handle, knowing how easy it would be to spring up and slaughter them all. Still, that isn't your only option.
*choice
    #Kill them all.
        You spring off your impossibly tall chair and charge for Thrym's head, easily smashing it, and you've killed two more before any of them can react. As the others roar in rage and attack you, you spot Loki slithering behind a giant table leg.

        It takes you under a minute to kill every giant in the hall, and Loki looks faintly impressed as he emerges daintily from his hiding place.

        "Not bad." he comments.

        The two of you walk out to the sled, and set off back towards Asgard.

    #Incapacitate them.
        You spring off your impossibly tall chair and charge for Thrym's knees, easily smashing them, and you've crippled two more before any of them can react. As the others roar in rage and attack you, you spot Loki slithering behind a giant table leg.

        It takes you under a minute to incapacitate every giant in the hall, and Loki looks impressed as he emerges daintily from his hiding place.

    #Intimidate them.
        You stand up, throwing off you veil and headress and revealing yourself in all you power.

        There are gasps of shock and anger and fear from the giants, and Thrym bellows, "What???"

        "I am ${name}, ruler of

            There's silence in the hall, as the giants galre at you, minds working, and Loki slips away behind a giant table leg.

            Then Thrym steps backwards. He looks around at his extended family, and at you, then nods slowly. The giants back up, clearing a path to the door, and you stride out of the hall. A few seconds later, Loki joins you.

            "Not bad." he comments, as you climb back into the sled and set off for Asgard.

            As you enter Asgard, the waiting gods cheer, and Thor comes running out to take his hammer. He crades it happily, then hugs you tightly enough to kill a human.

            "Thank you!" he booms, and Loki answers.

            "You're welcome." he smiles.

            There are celebrations in Asgard that night, and they go on well into the next day. Everyone is intensely relieved, and this incident will stick in their minds for a while. You, Loki and Heimdall came out of it extremely well.
