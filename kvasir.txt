    Not much has been happening in Asgard for quite a while, when you find yourself struck by a stronger than usual dream.

    You see Kvasir, the wise god, hanging over a large vat with his throat cut. Next to the vat, two dwarves are laughing, while in the background, a giantess cries blood.

    When your eyes fly open, you know that Kvasir's in danger.

            But that was all a long time ago. 
            
            Now, Odin tells to you how Kvasir died.

            He was spreading his wisdom in Svartalfheim and was asked for a private consult by a pair of dwarves. They brought him back to their house and murdered him, then used his blood to make mead.

            "The mead," Odin explains, "is magical, and it will grant wisdom and skill at poetry to any who drink it. I want your help in getting it from the giant Suttung, who took it from the dwarves as blood money. They killed his parents, you see."
            *choice
                #"What do you need me to do?"
                    "Suttung has a brother - Baugi - who has a farm. I want to gain a favour from him, and I need you to get rid of his nine servants."
                    *choice
                        #"I can do that - I'll kill them."
                            You set out for Jotunheim and arrive at Baugi's farm, where you easily locate his servants, who are out cutting tall grass with scythes taller than houses.

                                You draw weapons and charge the servants, cutting them all apart in just a few seconds. Then, leaving them dead on the grass, you report back to Odin. He thanks you for your aid, then heads for Baugi's house to offer his services.

                                After that you return to Asgard.

                                        They accepted your offer, and you burned away the ice.

                                        Not only did the ice stop, but your display of power persuaded the jotun to retreat.

                                        The elves were very grateful, and taught you some magic. They also promised you a favour, which might come in useful in the future.

                                        The elves accepted this, and you remained in Alfheim for the rest of the war.

                                        They did eventually drive back the jotun, but they lost a lot of people doing it, and they were weakened by the battles.

                                They took it well, but they did ask that you leave a few weeks later.

                                You returned to Asgard, where the war was almost over, and were present at the treaty where Kvasir was created.

                        After a while, you met a giantess, who greeted you politely, and introduced herself as Aurboda.

It takes you a few days to track Kvasir using his dreams, but you eventually find him in Svartalfheim, talking to a large group of dwarves.

Before you can speak to him, he is approached by the pair of dwarves from your dream, and the three of them start to walk away.
*choice
    #Shout out a warning.
        *set Kvasir %+60
        You call out to him, telling him that they're planning to kill him, and he turns. Behind him, the two dwarves exchange glances, then set off running.

        "Let them go." says Kvasir calmly.
        *choice
            #Ignore him and go kill the dwarves.

                It isn't hard - you are a god, after all. You don't even get any blood on you.

                Nonetheless, as you walk back over to Kvasir he gives you a disapproving look.

                "That was unnecessary." he says, then he sighs, "But I suppose I owe you thanks. Shall we return to Asgard?"
                *finish Go home.
            #Let them go.
                *set Kvasir %+10
                "Thank you." Kvasir says, "Both for warning me and for sparing them. Shall we return to Asgard?"
                *finish Go home.

        *set Kvasir %+60
        They aren't hard to kill - you are a god, after all. You don't even get any blood on you.

        As you turn back to Kvasir, you find him staring at you in horror.

        You explain your dream to him, and he sighs.

        "Then I suppose I owe you thanks. I just wish it hadn't been necessary to to kill them. Shall we return to Asgard?"
        *finish Go home.
    #Follow them silently.
        You let yourself fade until you can't be seen, and stalk after them.

        They head to a small house by a lake and go inside. Physical barriers mean little to you, and you drift through the door, invisible.

        The room you're in is small, and made smaller by the two large vats - like the one from you dream - inside it.

        Kvasir studies the vats, and his expression shifts to one of alarm. He takes a few hurried steps backwards, but the dwarves have already picked up clubs.
        *choice
            #Appear and fight them.
                *set Kvasir %+60
                They aren't hard to kill - you are a god, after all. You don't even get any blood on you.

                Kvasir stares at you silently for a few seconds, then murmurs a stunned "Thank you."

                He takes a few minutes to collect himself, then offers you a smile.

                "Shall we return to Asgard?"
                *finish Go home.
            #Appear and scare them.
                *set Kvasir %+70
                You appear before them, a nightmare made solid, and they stare at you, then run for the door, shoving each other in their desperation to get away.

                Kvasir stares at you silently for a few seconds, then murmurs a stunned "Thank you."

                He takes a few minutes to collect himself, then offers you a smile.

                "Shall we return to Asgard?"

                *set Kvasir_status 0
                The dwarves set on Kvasir, hitting him over the head while he cries out. Eventually he slumps, and they tie him up and hang him over one of the vats. Then they slit his throat.

                As his blood pumps out, the dwarves start pouring honey into a kettle, snickering together about their good fortune.
                *choice
                    #Slip away.
                        You fade back through the door and return to Asgard. You've only been back a few days when a rumour starts to spread - 
                        *goto kvasir_dead
                    #Ask what they're doing.
                        They jump almost out of their skins when you fade into view behind them. Once you ask your question, they rush to answer.

                        "We're making mead!" they yammer, "We're using the blood of a god to make it magical. We think it will give us his knowledge and wisdom."
                        *choice
                            #"It will give[i] all of us[/i] his knowledge and wisdom."
                                "Yes! Of course! That's fine!"

                                You stay there as they make the mead, and when it is done you drink down several mouthfuls.

                                It tastes better than anything you have tasted before, even better than Idunn's golden apples, which maintain your youth and health. As you drink, you feel power flow through you.

                                After that, you return to Asgard, getting back a few days before the news of Kvasir's death reaches them. Fortunately, no-one guesses at your involvement, believing you to have been working on some kind of spell to gain you power. Perhaps Odin suspects something - you catch his eye on you more often than usual over the next few days - but he doesn't say anything, and soon he departs Asgard.

                                For a few seconds, the dwarves look like they are going to complain, but they think better of it.
                                
                                You stay there as they make the mead, and when it is done you drink down several mouthfuls.

                                Then you take the rest of the mead - two vats and most of a kettle - and leave Svartalfheim. Heimdall would see you if you brought it in to Asgard, so you hide it in your dreams. You will be able to fetch it when you need it.

                                After that, you return to Asgard, getting back a few days before the news of Kvasir's death reaches the aesir.

        *if animal=100
            your falcon's eyes spot what he saw - a hawk flying frantically towards you, keeping just ahead of an eagle so big it can only be a transformed giant. Something about the eagle seems off, and after a few seconds of staring you figure it out. 

            "Odin." you say, and Heimdall nods.

            *goto odin_flees
        *else
            You scan the horizon, but you can't see anything. Heimdall notes your confusion and explains.

            "It's Odin. He's coming back as a hawk and something's chasing him. A giant I think. Changed into an eagle."

                        You pick up a rock from inside Asgard and take aim as the eagle gets closer. Then you hurl it with all of your strength, hitting the creature hard in the head. It crashes into the ground hard, and doesn't get up.

                        Odin lands beside you and thanks you, then explains that the giant was pursuing him because he stole a great treasure from him - a magical mead which gifts the speaker skill at poetry.

                        He grants some to Bragi, who immediately takes up playing the lyre, and some to you, and he saves the rest to give to human skalds in Midgard, as and when they are needed.

                        The mead tastes better than anything you have tasted before, even better than Idunn's golden apples, which maintain your youth and health. As you drink, you feel power and song flow through you.

                        You briefly see it flying towards you, and then everything goes dark. You didn't even feel the impact.

                            you extend a hand to wither it. It's feathers turn grey and crumble, and it starts to fall through the air. By the time it hits the ground, all that remains of it is dust.

                            your avian allies start to fill the air. Birds of every shape and size flock at the giant eagle, raking at its eyes and tearing at its wings. The creature shrieks, then turns and flees, while Odin lands beside you.

                    *set Odin %+20
                    You leap into the air and fly to Odin's aid.

                    How are you planning to help?

                        #I'll attack the eagle with my talons.

                                You dive at the eagle and rake at his eyes with your claws. He screeches in pain, and slows down to fight you, but you dance around him, taking advantage of your smaller size.

                                Then, when Odin is safely in Asgard, you veer off to follow him. Not tired out from a long flight, you outpace the giant easily and land beside Odin.

                                The Allfather thanks you, and explains that the giant was pursuing him because he stole a great treasure from him - a magical mead which gifts the speaker skill at poetry.

                                He grants some to Bragi, who immediately takes up playing the lyre, and some to you, and he saves the rest to give to human skalds in Midgard, as and when they are needed.
    
                                The mead tastes better than anything you have tasted before, even better than Idunn's golden apples, which maintain your youth and health. As you drink, you feel power and song flow through you.

                                You feel your bones - fragile bird bones - shatter, then it all goes dark.

                                You dive past the eagle, bathing him in fire, and he screeches in pain, starting to tumble through the air. As he burns, he falls faster and faster, and he crashes against the ground hard, and doesn't get up.

                                Once you return to Asgard, Odin thanks you, and explains that the giant was pursuing him because he stole a great treasure from him - a magical mead which gifts the speaker skill at poetry.

                                You dive past the eagle, catching hold of the magic inside him and blasting it apart. He regains his giant form, and tumbles through the air, suddenly lacking wings. He hits the ground hard, and doesn't get up.
