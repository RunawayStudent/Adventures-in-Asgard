                                                    It takes him over an hour to agree, a process not helped by the series of smug comments Loki insists on making, but the thunder god finally relents, and stalks away. He's gone for now, but he won't forget this.

He's in a blind rage now, and for a few seconds it looks like he might kill you. Then Loki calls out of your home in an uncharictaristically shrill voice.

                                                    "I can fix it!" he yelps, "I can fix Sif's hair!"

                                                    "Hrrr." he growls, and Loki hurries to explain.

                                                    "The dwarves. They can make new hair. I can get them to. Just give me some time."

                                                    Thor stares up at him, grunts again, then lowers his axe and turns to walk away.

                                                        The God of Thunder stares for a few more seconds, then lowers his axe and turns to walk away.

                                        He glares back at you a little longer, then turns and stalks away. He's gone for now, but he won't forget this.

                    Loki does his best to swallow. Sif is the much loved wife of the thunder god Thor. She takes a great deal of pride in her golden hair, and has a sharp tongue that rivals even Freya's. She and Thor adore each other, and they constantly appear at each other's sides and enter each other's space. Thor is absolutely willing to kill over this..

        He stays away for a few days, while Thor stomps around Asgard starting fights, and Sif stays hidden at home.

        *label gethair
        He's probably right though; if anyone can make magical hair for Sif, it's the dwarves. Unfortunately, it's notoriously hard to buy their favour - almost anything people can offer them they can make.

                where you find a tavern where the master craftsmen drink. Then you announce that you will give a draught from the mead of poetry to anyone who can make you golden hair that will bond with Sif's head.

                There is immediate interest, and two dwarves approach you from different tables.

                "I am Brokk." says one, "My brother and I are the greatest smiths around. We can make perfect hair for you."

                The other dwarf shakes his head furiously.

                "No!" he bursts out, "My three brothers and I are the sons of Ivaldi - the greatest smith ever! We can make much better hair than Brokk and Eitri! We'll even make other gifts for you, too!"

                Brokk glares at him.

                "So will we."
                *choice

                        "He'll make the hair." Brokk decides, "My brother and I will make three other gifts. For Thor, Odin and Frey. Meet back here in two days."

                        Then he turns around and walks out of the tavern.

                        Ivaldi's son stares after him open-mouthed.

                        "That… He… That wretch!"

                        He turns to you.

                        "Right. I'll make three gifts then, and you can be sure they'll be better than his. You'll be the judge."

                        Then he stamps away.

                You explain Sif's situation to them, and they confer, then two dwarves approch you.

                "I am Brokk." says one, "My brother and I are the greatest smiths around. We can make perfect hair for you."

                The other dwarf shakes his head furiously.

                "No!" he bursts out, "My three brothers and I are the sons of Ivaldi - the greatest smith ever! We can make much better hair than Brokk and Eitri! We'll even make other gifts for you, too!"

                Brokk glares at him.

                "So will we."
                *choice
                    #I'll accept Ivaldi's son's offer.
                        *label ivaldi
                        He grins, and leads you to his smithy. There, all four sons of Ivaldi set to work.

                        Watching them is amazing - they weave molten metal more swiftly and efficiently than a spider weaves a web, and it isn't long before you have a golden wig before you, which the sons assure you will bond with Sif's head.

                        "We will do you two more gifts." one of them decides, "Who do you want them for?"
                        *choice
                            #Odin, the Allfather.

                                Calm and patient, with a lot more knowledge than he lets on, he might make a powerful ally.

                                Cheerful and enthusiastic, but honestly a little dim, Frey is the god of fertility. He's very popular among the humans in Midgard, who worship him for his help with their harvests, and he's had at least fifty demigod children with them.

                                You know he'll be delighted to receive a gift.

                                Serious and honourable, it's rare that Tyr speaks, and even rarer that he smiles. He trains frequently, and frowns almost all the time.

                                It's just possible a gift could make him smile.

                                Peaceful and merry, Baldur is loved by the giants as much as by the gods and humans. 
                                
                                Ivaldi's sons are delighted at the idea of making a gift for him.

                                One of the vanir, Njord was traded to the aesir as part of a treaty. Since then, he's spent as little time there as possible, prefering his little house by the sea in Midgard, and visiting only when necessary. He resents being unable to go home, and he can be nasty to people beacuse of it, but there's no real malice in him.

                                Perhaps a gift will cheer him up?

                                        Odin's wife, Frigg is protective of everyone around her, and puts herself through a great deal with her visions trying to keep them all safe. 
                                        
                                        She spends a lot of her time worrying about her family, so maybe a gift will be good for her.

                                        An anxious but loving woman, Sigyn supresses her more powerful abilities in favour of staying at home. She has endless patience for her two little boys, and her whirlwind of a husband, and regularly brings gifts of food for her neighbors. Still, occasionally you spot her hands shaking, or hear a sob in her voice.

                                        She worries constantly for her family and friends, and her smiles seem a little too synthetic. Perhaps a present would inspire a real one? And she's also a goddess of victory, which could make her a valuable ally.

                                        Probably the most sensible of Asgard's inhabitants, Vor sits out most of what goes on, prefering to just watch and learn things. Sometimes, though, she offers advice and ideas, and they're always good.

                                        She'd make a valuable ally.

                                        Extremely intelligent, but painfully shy, Fulla talks to almost no-one besides Frigg and Baldur, and they confide in her a lot. She often runs errands for them, and you know Loki thinks she spies for them, so she could be a very useful ally.

                                        And who knows? Maybe she wants to be close to more than two people?

                                        An absolute sweetheart, Idunn is lovely to everybody. A lot of people think that she's foolish for being so trusting, but in reality she's well aware of the risks, and she simply prefers the chance of being betrayed to a life suspecting people.

                                        Still, she'll be thrilled to get a present.

                                        A relationship with Ran could certainly be useful.

                                            First they take an enormous chunk of clay and shape it into a horse, then they drizzle gold over it's mane and tail. Finally, they breathe life into it and it looks around. They place a halter on it, and offer the reins to you.

                                            "For Heimdall." they say, "This horse will always know where it's owner is, and will always be able to hear their commands."

                                            "For Frey." they say, "When unfolded, this will become a ship large enough to carry all the aesir, and it will always sail with the wind, but it can be folded up again into a cloth."

                                            "For Tyr." they say, "This shield is unbreakable, and no-one who carries it can be knocked off their feet."

                                            "For Loki." they say, "Whatever is seen by this eye is seen by its owner, and it can be commanded to fly anywhere."

                                            "For Baldur." they say, "This breastplate is unbreakable, and whoever wears it shall rule on the battlefield."

                                            They take some gold and a handful of precious stones, and fashion a necklace. When they show it to you, you can't help gasping at its beauty. You feel jealousy twinge inside you as you take it.

                                            "And that's for Freya. The most beautiful item for the most beautiful goddess."

                                            One of the sons of Ivaldi gets an unpleasant leer on his face.

                                            "And this is for Frigg. If she focuses on the grain in the wood, it will tell of the next death to come near to her."

                                            They offer it to you when they're done.

                                            "This is for Sigyn. Any bowl placed on one side will hold exactly the weight that she places on the other."

                                            "And this is for Vor. It enhances the sight of its wearer, and it captures all of their memories."

                                            They take a block of gold and melt it, then stretch it out into threads. Then, they weave the threads into a long, thin band.

                                            "This is for the goddess Fulla. When she wishes, it will hide her."

                                            They melt an iron ingot and stretch it into threads, then start to weave. Eventually, they present you with a silvery dress.

                                            "And this is for Idunn. When she wears it, she will be safe from all outside harm, and it will never be dirty."

                                            You smile at him and present him with the horse's reins.

                                            He takes the reins and lays a hand on the animal's neck, and it nickers.

                                            "Thank you." he says, sounding genuinely touched as he strokes the horse's nose.

                                            She reaches out, and can't supress a grin when she feels it. She unties her scarf and raises the hair to her head. A shimmer runs through it, and she gasps. You have to admit, the new hair looks spectactular.
                                            
                                            Thor kneels in front of her to take her hands and kisses them.

                                                "Nice work." he comments.

                                                "It's magical." you tell him, "If you stab with it, it can't be stopped, and any oath sworn on it is unbreakable."

                                                A slight smile tugs at the corner of his lips and he nods at you. Odin doesn't like to show his feelings, but you can tell he's delighted.

                                                    "Every nine nights eight ordinary arm-rings will drip from it."

                                                    The subtle smile increases; he's very pleased with you.

                                                Frey opens the door for you and

                                                    gives the boar a surprised look. Then he turns to you and smiles.

                                                    "Yes?"

                                                    You smile at him.

                                                "I brought you something." you say, nodding towards the pig on its chain, "He's called Gullinbursti. He can run on water and air, and he never tires. His bristles" - you point to the animal's mane - "glow at night."

                                                Frey stares, starting to grin.

                                                "For me?" he asks.

                                                You nod, and he bounces happily on his heels.

                                                "Thank you!" he says, then reaches out and pats the boar's snout.

                                                    He takes it, slight confusion clouding his delight.

                                                    "It's pretty." he says fingering the embroidery.

                                                    "It's magical." you explain, "If you unfold it, it'll become a ship that can carry us all, and that always has a following wind. But you can also fold it up again."

                                                    Frey stares at it, and then at the golden boar, and beams.

                                                    He launches himself forwards and hugs you.

                                                    "Thank you!" he says, then half-walks, half-runs towards the Bifrost, flapping his hands with eagerness to try out his prizes.

                                                He takes it, confused, and looks up at you.

                                                "Uh… It's very pretty?"

                                                He's there, swordfighting with Baldur, and winning.

                                                You call out to him and he raises a hand, stopping the duel, then bows to his opponent and strolls over.

                                                "${name}."

                                                You smile at him.

                                                "I brought you something." you say, holding out the shield.

                                                His perpetual frown lightens a little as he takes it, then deepens as he studies the straps.

                                                "These are strange." he observes.

                                                "The dwarves who made said that that was how the straps wanted to be." you tell him, "They enchanted it, too; it can't be breached, and while you carry it you can't be knocked over."

                                                He smiles ever-so-slightly, and bows to you.

                                                "My thanks. I shall put it to good use in defense of Asgard."

                                                He examines the shield a little longer, then strides back towards Baldur.

                                                You call out to him and he raises a hand, stopping the duel, then nods to his opponent and strolls over.

                                                "Hi, ${name}!" he says cheerfully.

                                                "I brought you something." you tell him, holding out the breastplate, "It can't be broken, and it will help you on the battlefield."

                                                Baldur grins, and you can't keep your own mouth from smiling.

                                                "It's fantastic!" he proclaims, running his hands over the golden metal, "Thank you!"

                                                He laughs slightly - a beautiful sound you hear a lot around him - and adds, "I want to hug you now. May I?"

                                                        He does indeed hug you, and then strikes up a conversation about where you got it.
                                                    #"No."
                                                        "Fair enough." he chuckles, and then strikes up a conversation about where you got it.

                                                Eventually, the talk peters out, and he returns to his training with Tyr, dancing slightly as he walks, and looking fantastic in the breastplate.

                                                You go to find Loki next. It takes you a while, because he's still hiding from Thor, but eventually a voice calls out from behind you.

                                                "So… is Sif happy again?"

                                                "Yes." you say as you turn, "And I brought you something, too."

                                                You open your hand, revealing the little, silver-plated eye.

                                                He gives you an odd look and takes it, and the iris turns from

                                                Loki gasps as the images come to him, and blinks rapidly a few times. Then he looks back up at you.

                                                "Wow." he says.

                                                "It obeys commands." you tell him, "Try it."

                                                He lifts it up and whispers to it, and its silver wings blur as it takes off. He grins as it dashes away and his eyes sparkle with delight.

                                                "That," he says, "will come in useful."

                                                He nods at you cheerfully, then turns and walks away.

                                                You go to find Njord next in his seaside house, and he opens the door for you. He really does seem much happier here, although he's giving you a very suspicious look.

                                                "What do[i] you[/i] want?" he asks.

                                                "I'm just bringing a gift." you assure him, and he relaxes as you pull out the hook.

                                                He takes it and examines it.

                                                "It's magical." you explain, "It calls fish to it, and no line that you attach to it can be broken."

                                                He smiles then, and you realise that you have never seen him smile before.

                                                "Thank you." he says gruffly, "I shall treasure it, and make good use of it."

                                                He stares at you awkwardly for a few moments.
                                                
                                                "Can I invite you in?"

                                                        He steps aside and gestures inwards, and you spend a pleasant few hours talking, before returning home to Asgard.
                                                    #"No, thanks."
                                                        He nods, thanks you again clumsily, then shuts the door, and you return home to Asgard.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Freya's home.

                                                She opens the door to you, and, along with about six cats, stares at you.

                                                "Now's a bad time." she tells you, "I'm trying to think of a way to cheer up Sif. She's been ill."

                                                "I already did." you say, "She's feeling better now."

                                                Freya relaxes, offering you a smile, and her cats start to purr.

                                                "I brought you something, too." you add, showing her the necklace.

                                                She gasps at its beauty and almost snatches it from your hands. She puts it on at once and pulls a mirror out of the air, examining herself.
                                                
                                                She looks absolutely fantastic - even more so than usual - especially when she smiles. She leans forward and hugs you, then kisses your cheek.

                                                "I adore it!" she declares, then strides right past you towards Valhalla, ready to show off her new jewelry.

                                                You watch her go with a smile, and then return home to relax.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Frigg's bower. Usually, she stays with Odin, but every now and then she retreats to her home to work magic.

                                                She opens the door before you can knock and gives you a wan smile. She looks stressed.

                                                "Yes, ${name}?" she asks in a tired but friendly voice.

                                                "I have something for you." you say, offering her the staff.

                                                She takes it and runs her hands down it, and you notice that they are trembling a little.

                                                "It has been enchanted." she murmurs, "Very professional work, too. To help with my seeing?"

                                                You nod, and she sighs, then smiles again.

                                                "Thank you, ${name}. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, and this may save your life in the days to come."

                                                She sighs again, and shuts the door, leaving you in a thoughtful mood.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Sif's house. Loki sleeps there occasionaly, but he spends most nights in other people's beds. Sigyn is very understanding about it, and keeps the house ready for when he returns.

                                                She opens the door to you, holding one of her sons in her arms, and puts on her masking smile.

                                                "Hey, ${name}! Do you need to borrow something?"

                                                "Nope." you tell her, "I actually have a present for you."

                                                You produce the scales and offer them to her.

                                                "They're enchanted to help with your cooking." you explain, and the sides of her eyes crease.

                                                "That's wonderful of you, really." she says, "I'll pay you back."

                                                        Her eyes drop briefly.

                                                        "Thank you." she repeats.

                                                    #Thank her - she'll feel guilty otherwise.
                                                        She fumbles one-handed with a pouch, then presses it into your hands.

                                                For a few seconds it looks like she's going to say something more, but then a child bursts into tears inside her house, and she gives you a pained look.

                                                "I have to go." she tells you, and shuts the door, leaving you slightly concerned, but with nothing more to do than go home.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Vor's tower. She spends almost all of her time there, secluded and happy that way.

                                                She sees you coming from her window, and opens the door before you can knock.

                                                "${name}." she says evenly.

                                                "I have a gift for you." you explain, and she raises her eyebrows.

                                                "Thank you."

                                                You bring out the veil and hand it over, and she smiles.

                                                "It is lovely." she says, as she puts it on, and then gasps.

                                                "Oh… It's incredible. Memories…"

                                                She breathes heavily, as her hidden eyes flick back and forth.

                                                "Thank you." she says again, "This is amazing."

                                                She steps back and drops into a formal bow, then closes her door, and you return home.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Frigg's bower. Usually, the seer stays with Odin, but every now and then she returns home to work magic, and Fulla accompanies her.

                                                The handmaid opens the door before you get there and stares past you, swallowing.

                                                "I have something for you, Fulla." you say, and she gives a tiny nod.

                                                "Er… thank you." she whispers, still not looking at you as you produce the golden band.
                                                
                                                She reaches out weakly and takes it, then examines it.

                                                "It's… nice." she says, and you can barely hear her.

                                                "If you run a hand along it while wearing it, it will hide you."

                                                There's no sign of emotion in her face as she thanks you again, but

                                                She closes the door quickly, and you return home.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head to Idunn's garden. It's a lovely place, and Idunn is always happy to have visitors there.

                                                She bounces to her feet as you enter and hurries over.

                                                "Oh ${name}, I'm so glad you're here!" she chatters, in a tone that would sound cloyingly insincere from anyone else, "You just [i]have[/i] to see the magnolia!"

                                                She hurries you over to a tree with deep pink flowers.

                                                "Isn't it the most wonderful shade?" she asks happily.

                                                        "Was there something you wanted?"

                                                        "The violets, then! They're gorgeous!"

                                                        She leads you to another cluster of flowers, before finally asking, "Was there something you wanted?"

                                                            She looks slightly crestfallen.

                                                            "Oh… I'm afraid I don't have any… Was there something you wanted?"

                                                            "Oh, then you must see the lavender! The bees adore it!"

                                                "Yes. I brought you a present." you say, and she glows joyfully as you show her the dress.

                                                "Oh… It's amazing…  So soft!" she trills, caressing it.

                                                "It's enchanted, too." you tell her, "It'll keep you safe, and it never needs cleaning so you can wear it while gardening."

                                                She throws her arms around you, getting mud on your clothes.

                                                "Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you-thank-you." she burbles, "I love it!"
                                                
                                                Then she steps back, giggles, and drags you off to look at more of her garden.

                                                You watch him briefly, then head out for Aegir's undersea hall to give Ran her gift.

                                                The news of your arrival beats you there, and both Aegir and Ran come out to greet you.

                                                "News from Odin?" asks the god-giant of the sea.

                                                "No." you explain, "I have a gift for your wife."

                                                You nod towards Ran, and Aegir bows his head and departs. You take out the net and offer it to her, and she wraps it around herself like a shawl.

                                                "It's nice." she says.

                                                "And enchanted." you tell her, "It should be able to catch sailors' souls from home."

                                                She runs a hand along it on her shoulder, and smiles coldly.

                                                "Thank you." she says, "I shall use it well."

                                                Then she returns to her hall, and you go back to the Asgard.

                                                "Thank you!" he booms.

                                                You carefully extract yourself and catch your breath, then smile back at him.

                                                "I brought you something, too." you tell him, taking the hammer - small and light at the moment - and showing it to him.

                                                He frowns, confused.

                                                "It's a bit small." he mumbles, then his eyes widen as you make it grow.

                                                "It does more than that." you assure him, "It's unbreakable. It never misses its mark when thrown, and best of all it will always return to your hand."

                                                As you talk, you watch Thor's face break into a massive grin, and he cradles the hammer.

                                                Then he lurches forwards and hugs you again, and you feel your bones creak.

                                                "I'll remember this." he tells you after he releases you, "I'll remember all of it."

                                                And then he walks off, throwing and catching his hammer.

                        Brokk smiles slightly, and leads you to his brother's studio.

                        "My brother has been planning a gift for Thor for a long time." he tells you, "You made the right choice."

                        First, Eitri, who doesn't say a word and won't meet your eye, takes a block of gold and places it in his forge. He nods at Brokk and moves into a little room around the back where he can access the forge. Brokk takes a hold of the bellows.

                        "My brother doesn't like talking to people." he explains, and there's no hint of apology in his tone. 

                        You watch as he starts to pump, and eventually Eitri comes back. He removes the gold, now shaped like hair, and holds in tongs as it cools. Then he lays it down on a table and examines it, then turns to Brokk and taps the back of his wrist.

                        "It's finished." says Brokk, as Eitri takes an enormous slab of iron and puts it in the forge.
                        *page_break
                        This time they work for much longer, and Brokk's face glistens with sweat as he works the bellows.

                        Finally, Eitri returns, and draws a magnificent hammer out of the forge. He plunges it into an ice bath, then raises it and studies it. Then he drops it on the table and taps his wrist again.

                        He walks over to the big shelf where he keeps materials and scans it, while Brokk explains the properties of the hammer.

                        Then Eitri produces another block of gold and carries it to the forge. He meets his brother's eye and touches his forehead, then returns to his work-room.

                        "This one's for Odin." Brokk explains as he takes up the bellows again.

                        This time, when Eitri takes his creation from the forge, it's a beautiful, solid arm-ring. Brokk explains its properties, and then he and Eitri prepare one last gift, using a single ingot of silver.

                        They present it to you when it's done, and Brokk tells you that this gift is for you.

                        "They're arm braces." he explains, "And they'll give you strength to rival any giant."
                        
                        You compliment their skill and return home.

                            They exchange glances, and Brokk nods.

                            "Three gifts each then. My brother already has plans for one for Thor." - he nods at Ivaldi's son - "You can do the hair."

                            Ivaldi's son bristles. 

                            "That'll be easy." he says, "So I get to choose the other gods."

                            Brokk nods again and the other dwarf stares upwards.

                            "Frey." he says, "I have a good idea for him… And Odin. Best not to snub the Allfather, eh?"

                            "Alright." says Brokk, "Three gifts. The winner, as judged by ${name}, will be known as the greatest craftsman in Svartalfheim."

                            They agree to meet back here in two days, and then they leave to go to their respective smithies.

                            Two days later, Brokk and all four of Ivaldi's sons are before you.

                            Ivaldi's sons go first. They start by showing you the golden hair for Sif, which is far more impressive than you expected - it shines beautifuly.

                            Then they place a long spear on the table. It's a masterpice, with delicate runework all along it, and it looks fantastic.

                            "This is Gungnir." one of them explains, "It never misses its target when thrown, and any oath sworn on it is unbreakable. We thought it would suit Odin."

                            Then they take out a folded cloth. It has a pretty, embroidered design - runes of some kind - but it doesn't look like much.

                            "This is Skidbladnir, for the god, Frey." says another one, "When you unfold it, it becomes a ship big enough to carry all of the gods, and wherever it sails it will have a following wind."

                            They exchange satisfied glances, and the one you spoke to first gives Brokk a smug look.
                            *page_break
                            *set draupnir true
                            Brokk ignores Ivaldi's son and places a golden arm-ring on the table.

                            "My brother and I call this Draupnir. Every nine nights, eight golden arm-rings drip from it." - He offers a nasty smile to Ivaldi's sons - "Infinate wealth. Should impress Odin."
                            
                            Then he heads outside the tavern and brings in an enormous golden boar on a chain. It snorts furiously and takes a swipe at one of valdi's sons on the way past.

                            "He's called Gullinbursti. The golden-maned." 

                            He pats the animal's back and it snorts.

                            "He can carry a god, and he never tires. He can run across the sky and the sea, and he has glowing bristles in his mane to light his owner's way. We made him for Frey."

                            He wraps the boar's chain around the table leg, then reaches into his pocket.

                            "This is the true masterpiece." he tells you, as he produces a tiny hammer from his pocket. It grows as he lowers it to the table, becomming impressively large.

                            "It's called Mjollnir, and it's for Thor. It never misses a target, it can't be broken, and it will return to the user's hand. You can shrink it to hide it, or so it can be carried by someone other than Thor. A truly fantasic piece."

                            Then he leans forwards, and you can smell his sour breath as he whispers the secret of the hammer's growth into your ear.

                            "Well!" Ivaldi's son interrupts impatiently, "Judge us!"
                            *choice

                                    Brokk nods in satisfaction, then walks away, smiling dourly.

                                    Ivaldi's sons glare at you, then move to the bar to drink, while you gather up the gifts. Gullinbursti studies you with mad piggy eyes, but allows you to take the end of his chain, and you head for home.

                                    Ivaldi's sons high five each other cheerfully, and head to the bar to celebrate, while Brokk simply walks away.

                            "No." he says, and walks away.

                            Ivaldi's son smirks at his departing back, then turns back to you.

                "Mmm?"

                "Maybe you should talk to them."

                He smirks.

                "What? You need my help? Well, I suppose…"

                He trails off as he catches your expression. 

                "Yeah… I'll deal with it."

                He taps you on the shoulder, then strides off towards the Bifrost, stopping briefly on the way to drag a piece of metal along the edge of Baldur's house.
                *page_break
                He stays away for a few days, and Sif stays in her home the whole time, while Thor stamps around starting fights with people.

            #"Sure. Just don't damage anything."

            #"No. I have no idea what you might do."
                He looks briefly offended, then shrugs again.

                "Yeah. Fair enough."
        
        You leave him there, and walk to Thor's house, thinking about what to say on your way.

        When you knock on the door, it's Freya who opens it.

            "Sif is feeling a bit low." she says, "And Thor isn't in."

            "I know." you tell her, "May I talk to Sif?"

            "Sure." she decides, "I trust you."

            She leads you through the many rooms of Bilskirnir, explaining on the way that she was woken by one of Sif's handmaids, who was concerned about her mistress.

                        "He nearly got me sold to a builder." Freya comments, "He's horrible."

                        You get up again and head to the kitchen - you've been in Bilskirnir before - where you rustle together a sandwich and grab a crystal glass full of water. Then you bring them back.

                        Sif takes them with a teary smile and downs the water.

                        "Thank you." she murmurs, "That does make me feel better."

        He strides off towards the Bifrost, stopping briefly on the way to drag a piece of metal along the edge of Baldur's house.

You put a hand on his massive shoulder.

"I know. But you can't just hurt people for revenge. Even Loki."

A tear runs from the corner of one of his blue-grey eyes.

"Sif…" he says pleadingly.

You take a deep breath and rub your eyes - its still far to early in the morning for all this - while Loki strolls over to you.

"If I were you," he advises, "I'd talk to the dwarves."

Then he walks off without even a goodbye.

*goto gethair
*label gift_gathering

Then Loki returns Asgard, accompanied by a strange dwarf and a giant golden boar.

He announces loudly that he brings gifts for Odin, Thor, Sif and Frey, and that he will present them in Valhalla. He also requests that all of the gods be present.

"The reason," he says, once everyone has gathered, "that I have asked so many of my friends here" -  eyebrows raise around the room at the word - "is to judge a competetion between myself and this… person, Brokk. We have each prepared three gifts - one each for the Allfather," - Odin gives a slight nod - "the thunder god," - Thor glares at him and grunts - "and my dear friend Frey."

Frey looks surprised, perhaps at his inclusion, or perhaps at being called Loki's friend.

"After the competition, you all get to vote on the victor. If I lose…" - his eyes become incredibly wide - "he gets my head."

"Present them." commands Odin, ignoring the entreaty.
*page_break
*set gungnir true
*set skidbladnir true
Loki smirks. Despite the imminent danger of decapitation, he looks tremendously pleased with himself.

"Of course…"

"For the Lady Sif, with my humblest apologies…"

He offers up a golden bundle of hair, and Sif disentangles herslef from Thor to take it. She removes the scarf from around her head, revealing her earth-brown scalp, then places the hair over it. There are gasps from the watchers, first at the sight of her baldness, and then at the beauty of her new hair. You see Freya step forward to take her hands, 
*if animal=100
    and you can just hear her compliments.
*if animal=0
    and, although you can't hear them, you can tell Freya is complimenting her.

Delighted to see his wife smile, Thor strides over to Loki and slaps him on the shoulder.

"Well done!" he booms.

Loki drops into one of his semi-ironic bows, then produces a beautiful silver-headed spear, with elegant runes down the side.

"For you, Allfather."

For once he doesn't sound sarcastic, but then, Loki can sound however he wants to.

"It's called Gungnir, and it can't be stopped by armour or by skill. And better, if you swear an oath on it, it can't be broken."

He spreads his hands triumphantly, and there's impressed muttering from the gods and the einherjar. Odin, however, stays totally impassive as he takes the spear, gracing Loki with a slight nod only.

Finally, the Trickster turns to Frey, and presents him with a folded cloth. It's fairly pretty, with embroided runes, but it doesn't look that impressive, and Frey utterly fails to hide his disappointment.

"Uh… it's nice." he tries.

Loki smirks again, enjoying the awkwardness, and waits a few seconds before explaining.

"Of course, it's not really a cloth. If you unfold it, it will become a magnificent ship, which will always have a following wind, and is capable of holding everyone in this room."

He pauses as he glances at the ranks of einherjar.

"Nearly." he adds.

As he speaks, Frey starts to bob up and down on the spot, flapping his hands in excitement. Then, abruptly, he launches himself at Loki and hugs him tightly.

"Thank you!" he beams, while Loki basks in admiration.
*page_break
*set gullinbursti true
*set hammer true
*set draupnir true
After only a few seconds, Odin interrupts.

"Time for Brokk to present his gifts."

Loki nods agreement.

"Of course!" he grins, "The Allfather insists he receive more presents."

Brokk steps forwards. He looks very bitter, and 
*if animal=100
    you can see painfully red bumps on his neck and eyelids - bug bites?
*if dream=100
    you can sense pure hatred in him - towards Loki?
*if (animal=0) and (dream=0)
    he glares at Loki as he prepares to present.

He starts with the giant boar, which attempts to gorge Loki as it passes him, and leads it up to an increasingly nervous Frey.

"This is Gullinbursti." he says, "He is loyal, unstoppable, and very powerful, and he can run over the sea and the sky. And these" - he runs a hand over large bristles in the animal's mane - "glow in the night to light your way."

"Uh… When you say loyal…" Frey still looks uncomfortable.

"He will obey your every command, and protect you with his life." Brokk gets a nasty smile, "And with his tusks."

"What about the rest of us?" asks Heimdall, instantly.

"Gullinbursti has only one master."

Heimdall nods gloomily, and 
*if animal=100
    you hear him mutter "[i]Perfect.[/i]" under his breath.
*if animal=0
    runs a hand through his hair.

A few of the other gods - Odin, Tyr and Vor - also look concerned, but Frey is delighted. The vanir reaches out to pet the boar, then leans happily against it. It snorts affectionately, but doesn't stop glaring at everyone else with its mad piggy eyes. Even Loki, still riding high on self-satisfaction, looks a little alarmed.

Brokk turns away from Gullinbursti and produces an arm ring from inside his black-leather coat.

"This," he proclaims, "is for Odin. It is called Draupnir, and it will drip eight more arm-rings every nine nights." He gives Loki a smug look, "Infinite wealth."

Odin takes the ring, still totally impassive, and slips it onto his arm.

Brokk turns away from him and towards Thor, looking darkly pleased.

"But this is the true masterpiece." he boasts, taking a delicate, four-inch hammer out of a pocket. Thor is already starting to sneer as the dwarf proffers it, but stops when the hammer starts to grow. It is a beautiful item, pure iron with decorative work hiding the runes. The handle does look a little short though.

Almost immediately, Brokk's arms start to shake with the effort of holding the increasing weight, and Thor steps in. He graps the handle in one hand - there's no room for the other, and swings it back and forth.

"Weight's off." he grumbles, "And the handle's too short."

"Yes." says Brokk bittery, 
*if dream=100
    and you sense his hatred for Loki pulse, 
*if dream=0
    casting Loki another sour look, 
"There was an[i] unaccountable accident[/i] with the bellows."

Loki fails to suppress a snicker as the dwarf continues.

"But it's still a masterpiece. If you throw it, it'll always hit your target. No matter how hard you smash it, it can't be broken. You can call it back to your hand at will, and it can shrink back down when you need someone else to carry it. We call it Mjollnir."

Thor starts to grin, and then to chuckle, and then finally laughs delightedly. His waving the hammer gets faster and faster, more and more out of control, and you see Heimdall roll his eyes and step behind a column, and Loki slips under a table. Thor finally releases, and the hammer flies through the air, taking out a sizable chunk of the ceiling on its way to nowhere. Before the sound has finished echoing, the hammer is back in his hand.

Odin's eye smoulders as he looks at the damage and then down at his son, but the other gods look delighted, and you know why; Most of Thor's fights with giants are conducted with his bare hands, because any weapons he starts with get broken in the first few minutes of battle. This hammer could give him a major advantage against Asgard's enemies. 
*if animal=100
    Loki must have figured that out too, because you can smell the sudden sweat on him. You watch as he emerges from under his table and eyes hole above him.

Brokk smiles again - another nasty one - and addresses Odin

"Time for the vote."
*page_break
Odin nods slowly, and for a few seconds he and Loki stare at each other.

"Yes." he muses, "I believe there was a wager on the result?"

"For my head." supplies Loki.

The Allfather nods again.

"Let the voting begin."

            "This is injustice." he hisses, "I demand he be caught!"

            Odin turns his head, and a flash of power comes from him. Flames burn in his eye, and you can hear distant creams and clashing swords. Brokk goes very pale, and he backs off as the Allfather speaks.

            "I think you ought to leave." says Tyr, calmly, stepping towards them.

            Brokk walks slowly towards the door, teeth gritted. At one point he turns around, and it looks like he's going to say something, but his courage fails and he walks out. Heimdall stops leaning aginst a column and quietly follows. 

            He returns ten minutes later to say, "He's gone."

            Only a few seconds after that, Loki drops down through the ceiling, spreading him arms like he's performed a miracle.

            "Enjoy your gifts!"

                        You throw a magical binding over him like a net over a butterfly and fling him back through the hole in the ceiling. He lands hard next to Thor, who takes a tight hold on him. Totally unflustered, he puts on an innocent expression.

                        You fly at him hard, snatching at his shoes with your talons, and successfully pulling one off. Stranded in the air and barely balancing on one foot, he glares at you. Then a lightning flash buzzes past you as Thor leaps past, taking a tight hold on Loki's arm and yanking him back down onto the roof of Valhalla. The two of them drop through the hole and disappear.

                        You fly down to land beside them as Loki puts on an innocent expression.

                        You make a grab for him with your talons as you pass, but he springs easily out of the way, laughing like this is a friendly game. You try again, and again, but he continues to dodge you effortlessly, and it's soon clear that you won't be able to catch him.

                        Reluctantly, you wheel around and fly back to Valhalla, where you dive back through the hole in the ceiling.

                        "I lost him." you admit, and Brokk turns furiously towards Odin.

                    "I lost him." you say, and as far as you can tell everyone believes you. Brokk turns furiously towards Odin.
                    *goto lokiflees
        *elseif cloak=true
            You sling on your feather cloak and spring into the air, blurring after him as a falcon. Built for the sky, you easily overtake him.
            *goto caughtup
        *else
            You lunge forwards, and then stop as you realise that you can't actually fly. However, you have managed to throw Thor off - he's surprised out of chasing Loki.

            Brokk glares at you, and then at Thor.
            *goto lokiflees
    #Let him.
        *label lightningfast
        He dashes upwards in a lightning flash, and is back almost immediately, holding an unflustered Loki by the upper arm. The trickster widens his eyes innocently.
        *label uhohagain

        "Fair enough." he says, "You do own my head. I can't argue with that."

        He stays totally still as Brokk approaches him with a knife, and helpfully tilts back his head. Then he leans back, raising a finger.

        "Uh, uh." he tuts, and Brokk stops in confusion.

        "[i]What?[/i]"

        "Well, you are [i]of course[/i] entitled to my head, but you were about to cut my [i]neck.[/i] That was [i]not[/i] in our contract."

        He spreads his arms and smiles.

        Brokk stares at him, confusion rumbling into fury.

        "[i]I can't take your head without cutting your neck.[/i]" he growls, and Loki winks at him cheerfully.

        Fuming, the dwarf turns to Odin.

        "[i]You can't let him do this.[/i]"

        Odin looks down at him impassively.

        "Your agreement is not our business." he states, and Brokk sets his jaw.

        "But the head is mine…"

        He picks up his nasty smile again, and lifts the knife. Loki rolls his eyes.

        "Oh, you are [i]kidding [/i]me." he jeers, "Give in! You cannot cut me."

        He stands there with a bored expression as Brokk approaches, and lays the knife against his mouth. You see Brokk's muscles clench, but the knife doesn't move, and Loki's confident smile widens.

        The dwarf steps back, eyes narrowing, then drops his knife and extends his hand. He concentrates, and an awl slowly fades into his hand.

        "My brother's." he grins, "Magical."

        *if animal=100
            Loki looks suddenly less confident, and Sigyn goes pale.
        *if dream=100
            You sense Loki suddenly loose confidence, and Sigyn goes pale.
        *if (animal=0) and (dream=0)
            No change comes over Loki's face, but Sigyn goes suddenly pale.
        
        "What are you going to do?" asks Loki, for once deadly serious.

        "I am going," he says, "to [i]sew your poisonous lips shut.[/i]"

        Loki swallows and looks around.

        "Uh… Some help here?"

        For the first time in a long time, he sounds genuinely frightened.

                    "He did this." the dwarf growls, jabbing the awl towards Loki.

                    "You have no proof of that!" Loki protests, and Brokk makes a noise like a snarling dog.

                    "Shut up, Loki." 

                    The words come from at least three mouths at once.

                    He stares at you for a few tense moments, then reluctantly lowers the awl.

                    "You." he says to Loki, "You owe me. And you owe that one."

                    He nods towards you. Then he turns around and walks out of the hall, leaving you surrounded by astonished gods; no-one thought you could pull that off. Even Loki looks briefly surprised, but it doesn't take him long to rebuild his usual slight smirk. Sigyn, though, is far less reserved. She hurries over to you, babbling with relief.

                    "Thank you, thank you, thank you. I… Oh, thank you."

                    She throws her husband a pointed look and he nods slowly.

                    "Yes." he says, "That." but you can tell his mind is elsewhere.

                    Sigyn sighs, then takes you arm as you leave Valhalla, continueing to whisper thanks.

                    Brokk thinks about it, then shakes his head.

                            He slips his awl into his belt, the frown in his face relaxing. Behind you, you hear Loki breathe out in relief, and Sigyn bursts into tears.

                            Halfway to the doors, Brokk turns towards you.

                            "I'll be back to collect it." he says, then leaves Valhalla.

                            You look around and you just have time to see Idunn give you an awed look before arms wrap around your neck.

                            You tense for a second, but it's only Sigyn, hugging you in gratitude.

                            "Thank you, thank you, thank you." she whispers tearfully, then leaps back, "Oh! Oh, I'm sorry! I should have asked! It's just… Thank you."

                            She throws her husband a pointed look, and he nods.

                            "Yes. That." he says, in an uncharacteristically shaken voice, but he isn't looking at you. He's staring at the other gods, thinking. Then his expression resets to it's usual mask and he takes Sigyn's hand. He meets your eyes for a second, and nods again, then the three of you exit Valhalla.

                            You lower your head.

                            "I'm sorry, Allfather." you say, and he nods solemnly.

                            "Do not do it again."

                            "Of course not." you assure him, and he dismisses you with a wave.
                            *label crossleave

                            As you walk out of the hall, Loki gives you a weak nod, and Sigyn mouths, 'thank you.' You've upset a few people today, but you've also made a friend. You may want to be careful around him, though; he's unpredictable, and it waits to bee seen if he will aid or betray you.
                            *finish 
                        #I'll apologise tersly.
                            You meet his eyes. You respect him, but you won't let him bully you.

                            "I apologise." you say, and he stares at you for a few seconds, then nods solemnly.

                            "Do not do it again."

                            "I won't." you tell him, and he dismisses you with a wave.

                            You meet his eyes. You respect him, but you won't apologise for doing the right thing.

                            "He was going to sew Loki's lips shut." you point out.

                    *label odincrosser

                    He gets up and walks towards you, and suddenly everything about him screams threat.

                            You take a few steps back, and he halts. Your display of respect has done the trick, and he dismisses you with a wave.
                            *goto crossleave
                        #Stand my ground.
                            You meet his eye fearlessly. You won't apologise for making your own choices.

                            You meet his eye fearlessly, and call your magic up again, ready to fight if necessary.

                            "Do not try to intimidate me." you warn him.

                                    The Allfather stares at you, then turns to his sons.

                                    "Thor, Tyr, escort ${name} out of Asgard."

                                    He turns back to you.

                                    "You are henceforth banished. I shall not see you again until…" his voice trails off, and you see real grief in him for a moment, "…until it ends."

                                    The last three words are so quiet only you hear them, and they echo in your head as you're removed from the hall. As you get to the door, 

                                    *if Freya>80
                                        *set freya_status 3
                                        Freya suddenly moves.

                                        She's at your side faster than your eyes can follow, and she wrenches Thor and Tyr off you. Her hair is on end again and her eyes are flashing furiously, and neither of them want to fight her. She takes your hand and pulls you towards the door.

                                        "Then I'm going, too." she hisses, throwing a furious look at Odin over her shoulder.

                                        "Uh… Freya…" her brother says, "Are you sure?"

                                        She turns her eyes on him and he goes pale.

                                        *if (kvasir>80) and (kvasir_status>0)

                                            "I agree." states Kvasir, calmly, "I, too, will accompany you."

                                            He comes forwards to walk out beside you.

                                            For a few seconds, it looks like Loki might follow, but he ultimately stays put as you stride out of Valhalla, and out of Asgard.

                                            As the two of you walk out, it looks for a second like Loki might follow, but he ultimately stays put as you stride out of Valhalla, and out of Asgard.
                                            *goto_scene kicked_out

                                        Kvasir speaks.

                                        "I will accompany you." he decides, and walks out beside you.

                                        For a few seconds, it looks like Loki might follow, but he ultimately stays put as you are marched out of Valhalla, and out of Asgard.
                                        *goto_scene kicked_out
                                    *else
                                        Loki makes eye contact with you. You can tell that he's thinking of following, but he chooses not to. Sigyn mouths 'thank you' as you are marched out of Valhalla and out of Asgard.
                                        *goto_scene kicked_out

                                    Odin's eye flares, and you feel the choke of a noose around your neck. 
                                    *if fire=100
                                        You light yourself on fire, burning it away, then

                                            hurl flaming hurricanes at him.

                                            You keep it up for a few seconds, and then he starts to shout in pain as his skin burns. He drops to the ground to roll, but the fire won't go out.
                                            *goto odinfalls
                                        throw the flames at him, but they lick at him harmlessly.

                                    *if death=100
                                        You wither it away, then
                                        *if magic>97
                                            reach out for him. His skin starts to grey and crack and then to crumble, and he shouts out in fear, but he can't stop you.
                                            *goto odinfalls
                                        reach out for him. His skin greys slightly, then clears as he throws off your influence.
                                        *goto odinkills
                                    *if animal=100
                                        You snap it as you transform yourself

                                            *achieve patricide
                                            into a dragon, getting gasps of awe from the gods. It only takes you one bite to destroy Odin, but it's the last bite you take. Almost immediately, Thor's new hammer smashes into your skull.
                                            *goto_scene dead
                                        back into a bear, and lunge for him, but he easily steps aside, then plunges his new spear into your flank. It hurts intensly but the pain doesn't last long, because a magical hammer slams into your skull.
                                    *if dream=100
                                        You let yourself fade and it falls to the ground. Then you reach for Odin's mind 
                                        *if magic>97
                                            and flood it with nightmares. He staggers back, his one eye wide, struggling to breathe through his terror.
                                            *goto odinfalls
                                        but you find it too well guarded.

                                    *if rain=100
                                        You move fast as it tightens, calling down water from the sky. 
                                        *if magic>97
                                            It tears through the roof of Valhalla, bringing the ceiling down onto the Allfather's head. Everyone present feels him die; in fact, it's the [i]last[/i] thing you feel before Thor's new hammer smashes into your skull.
                                            *goto_scene dead
                                        It crashes against the ceiling, but you aren't strong enough to bring down the roof, and your vision is always starting to darken. The last thing you feel is the burn of the tightening noose.
                                        *goto_scene dead
                                    *label odinkills

                                    You feel a change in the magic around him, but you don't get a chance to see what he's planning before Thor's new hammer smashes into your skull.
                                    *goto_scene dead

                                    There are cries of alarm from around the room, but it's too late; the last thing you see is the Allfather's death, before Mjollnir slams into your skull.
                                    *goto_scene dead
                            *else

                                Odin narrows his eyes, then sends a blast of magical energy into you, knocking you to the ground. He's at your side before you've recovered from the shock, and growls into your ear: 
                                
                                "Do [i]not[/i] challenge me again."

                                Then he stands up and looks around at everyone.

                                "This meeting is over." he declares, and people start to leave.
                                *page_break
                                On her way out, Sigyn stops to help you up.

                                "Thank you." she says, "Really."

                                She gives Loki a pointed look, and he nods.

                                "Yes. Good of you." he says, as the three of you exit Valhalla.
                                *finish

                *label ouch
                He steps back as Brokk walks towards him, but Thor tightens his grip on his shoulder. 
                *if Dream=100
                    You can sense anger in the thunder-god too; his delight at Sif's happiness has gone, and he wants to see Loki hurt. 
                The dwarf takes out a leather thong and holds it up to the trickster's head, then sets the awl against it and stabs a hole into his lips. Loki shudders as it goes it, and his eyes glisten with tears, but he doesn't make a sound. Sigyn does - a drawn out half-sob, half-whimper - but she refuses to look away. No-one else in the room even winces.
                *fake_choice
                    #Including me.
                        You watch impassively through

                        You flinch at 
                every one of the twelve stabs, as tears run down Sigyn's face, and Loki jerks in pain.

                Brokk tightens the thong that he used for the sewing, then steps back, admires his work for a few seconds, then nods and heads for the door. Heimdall slips out after him.

                Once the dwarf has gone, Thor looses his hold on Loki, and the trickster drops to the ground. Thor wipes his hands on his tunic pointedly, then returns to his wife's side. He runs a hand through her new hair, kisses her, and then leads her out of the hall.

                Sigyn runs forward to her husband's side to help him up, and you can see that they're both shaking. Loki glares around the room at everyone and 
                *if dream=100
                    you feel something new and spiteful in him. He meets Odin's eye briefly, then 
                reaches up to his lips. He grabs the leather and wrenches it out, and this time he does cry out slightly with the pain of it. He stuffs the thong into a pocket and walks out silently. 
                *comment pocket?
                *if animal=100
                    Your eagle's eyes catch the spilling tears he can't stop.
                *page_break
                It's over a week before anyone besides Sigyn sees Loki, but eventually he emerges from his home, and he seems pretty much like his old self. 
                *if dream=100
                    Still, from time to time you sense flashes of hatred from him. Something in him has changed, and he won't forget this.
                    *finish
                He smiles and laughs and minorly terrorises people, and acts like nothing happened, but from time to time you see him brooding - something he never used to do - and 
                *if Odin>80
                    you know that Odin is watching him closely. This incident may be over, but its effects will be around for a long time.
                    *finish
                some of the looks he gives you seem to have more depth than before. This incident may be over, but its effects will be around for a long time.
                *finish

                You walk out of the hall before Brokk can start, and it isn't long before you're pacing uncomfortably before your home. After a few minutes, Brokk leaves Valhalla and heads straight for the Bifrost, and shortly after that Loki and Sigyn hurry home.
                *page_break
                It's over a week before anyone besides Sigyn sees Loki, but eventually he emerges from his home, and he seems pretty much like his old self.

                    Still, from time to time you sense flashes of hatred from him. Something in him has changed, and he won't forget this.
                    *finish
                He smiles and laughs and minorly terrorises people, and acts like nothing happened, but from time to time you see him brooding - something he never used to do - and 
                *if Odin>80
                    you know that Odin is watching him closely. This incident may be over, but its effects will be around for a long time.
                    *finish
                some of the looks he gives you seem to have more depth than before. This incident may be over, he hasn't forgotten it.
