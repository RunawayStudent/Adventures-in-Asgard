      #Aegir
        Technically giants, Aegir and his wife, Ran, are allies of the aesir. Aegir is god of the sea, and he lives in an immense hall outside of Asgard.

      #Baldur
        Baldur is the beloved god - absolutely [i]everyone[/i] likes him, even the giants. He's polite and merry, always in a good mood, and often dances or laughs randomly. He's one of the sons of Frigg and Odin, and unarguably their favourite. From time to time, though, he has prophetic dreams that scare him.

      #Bragi
        Bragi is the god of poetry. He is one of the most amiable of the Asgardians, and he is hopelessly in love with Idunn.

      #Heimdall
        Heimdall is the watchman of the gods. Smart, quiet, and immensely patient, he prefers watching and learning to taking action. He spends most of his time in Himinbjorg, his hall at the end of the Bifrost, where he keeps watch over all the nine worlds.

      #Idunn
        Idunn is the holder of the Golden Apples - the secret behind the gods' eternal youth. She is exceptionally nice and trusting, and a lot of people take this to mean that she is stupid - Loki says so all the time. In reality, Idunn is perfectly aware of the risks she takes by trusting people, and simply prefers it to the constant intrigue and suspicion the other gods indulge in.

      #Loki
        Loki is the trickster god. He is sly, proud, and sometimes spiteful, and collects enemies like a butterfly enthusiast with a giant net. Despite being technically very intelligent, Loki never thinks ahead, which gets both him and the people around him into a lot of trouble. It's possible he'd make a powerful ally, but he's so untrustworthy that no-one dares find out. He's the cause of many of Asgard's problems, and the solver of many, too. For better or worse, he makes things happen.

      #Odin
        Odin is the leader of the gods, and the father of most of them. He created humanity and the worlds from the corpse of a giant, and now he spends most of his time trying to stop it all from ending. He's extremely powerful and utterly ruthless, and he keeps almost everything he knows secret. He thinks in riddles and watches the future, and he manipulates everyone around him in his attemps to preserve Asgard.

      #Thor
        Thor is the god of thunder. He is enormous, and very powerful, and giants everywhere are terrified of him. He's not particualrly intelligent, but he's never needed to be; he deals with all of his problems the same way, by hitting them. On the rare occasions he runs into something he can't hit, he outsources the thinking to Odin or Loki. He is happily married to Sif, and they live in the giant hall Bilskirnir with their daughter and two sons. Despite his terrifying temper, he is quite good-natured most of the time.

      #Vor
        Vor is the goddess of knowledge. She lives in a tower full of smoke, which helps with her magic - given enough time she can access information on almost anything that has happened in any of the nine worlds. Years of inhaling magical smoke have ruined her voice and vision to the point that not even the Golden Apples can cure her, but she considers this an acceptable cost for the knowledge she gains.
