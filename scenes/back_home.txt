You enter the great hall of Valhalla, and walk past tables full of the einherjar - dead warriors handpicked by Odin for his army - and approach the raised throne.

Cold, calculating and enigmatic, Odin rules Asgard with an iron fist, demanding loyalty, and getting it. He is the father of most of the aesir, and of the human race, and it is down to him that the nine worlds were created at all. He sits straightbacked on his throne, staring out at those worlds and planning for the future, and no-one really knows what those plans entail.

He lets very few people into his confidence, 
*if Odin>50
  and you are one of them. Even so, he doesn't trust you entirely - he truly trusts only himself.

*else
  and you are not one of them.

*label allfathershall

As you come before him, his single eye - the other was sacrificed for wisdom at Mimir's well - refocuses as he brings his mind back into the here and now.

*if Odin>50
  He smiles slightly to see you, and bows his head respectfully. 

  "${name}, how was your mission?"
  *goto what_job
*else
  He looks you over with a face like granite then narrows his eye and speaks in a neutral tone.
  
  "How was your mission?"

  On that subject, [i]what[/i] was your mission?
  *choice
    #It was diplomatic.
      *set Diplomacy +5
      *set Charm +5
      I see. Who were you negotiating with?
      *choice
        #The giants in Jotunheim.
          *set Diplomacy %+10
          *set Odin %+10
          Of course!
          *page_break
          Odin is pleased when you tell him of your success dealing with the Jotun. This peace probably won't last long, but it's still valuable to him.
          *finish Settle down and feast.
        #The dwarves in Svartalfheim.
          *set Diplomacy %+10
          *set Odin %+10
          Of course!
          *page_break
          Odin is delighted when you say your mission went well. The dwarves are master craftsmen, and he likes to have them on his side.

        #The light elves in Alfheim.
          *set Charm %+10

          Of course!
          *page_break
          Odin nods as you inform him of your success. The elves are both powerful and wise, but they are also hard to predict. Still, it never hurts to have people on your side, and Odin knows that.
          *finish Settle down and feast.
    #I was going to war.
      *set Strength %+20
      I see. Who were you fighting?
      *choice
        #The giants in Jotunheim.
          Right. They were encroaching on Asgard again, weren't they? 
          *page_break
          *set Odin %+10
          Odin is relieved when you tell him the invasions were stopped, and he offers you a slight nod.

          Oh, yes. A job you're perfect for.
          *page_break
          Odin is pleased to hear that you did a bit of damage to Muspellheim. It should keep them away for a while.

      Ah, yes. For whose benefit was it, again?
      *choice
        #For myself, of course!
          Of course. Your spell went off perfectly, and it strengthened your magical abilities.

          Odin is delighted to hear about the spell's success. He offers you the seat at his side.

          Right!

          Oh! He could have been nicer to you earlier then, couldn't heâ€¦

          *set Loki %+15
          Odin takes the news of your success impassively, then invites you to eat.

        #It was a favour for the dwarves.

          I see. That may pay in the future.
