Now that situation is dealt with, let's hear a bit about you. I know you're a god, but what are you a god of?
*choice
  #Dream
    *set Dream +100
    Existing on the edge between reality and imagination, you are ethereal, graceful, and sometimes almost invisible. Magic comes easily to you, and sometimes you can sense people's thoughts and desires, or see glimpses of the future.

    It comes at a cost though, as many of Asgard's tougher warriors mistrust you. Odin finds you useful though, and respects your abilities.

  #Animals
    *set Animal +100
    A shapeshifter with incredible senses, you're as likely to be seen soaring on updrafts as an eagle, as walking four-legged down the streets of Asgard. Even when you keep to a human form, your eyes sometimes seem a little slitted, and strange shadows might give the impression of fur. 
    *comment other gods can't get as big
    You can also call on other animals as spies or as soldiers, making you a scary foe.

  #Fire
    *set Fire +100
    A god of fire, you crackle with power constantly. You're never too cold and never too hot, and you have an overwhelming advantage in a fight. 

    Your displays of anger can be terrifying, and most of the gods keep out of your way, but Loki loves to taunt you.

  #Death
    *set Death +100
    A god of death, you rule over Helheim, and the dishonourable dead. You are capable of withering your enemies into dust, and you can call up skeletons to aid you.

    Your presence demands respect, and not even Thor starts fights with you. You live in Asgard at Odin's invitation, and he values your abilities a great deal.

  #Rain
    *set Rain +100
    Lacking in the dramatic powers of most of the gods, you don't get much respect from the tougher gods. On the other hand, the women of Asgard get on with you quite well.
